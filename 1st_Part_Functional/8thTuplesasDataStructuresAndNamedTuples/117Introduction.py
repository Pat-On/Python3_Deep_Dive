        Tuples

Tuples are...


    read-only lists...  at least that is how many introductions to Python will present tuples!!

    This is not wrong, but there is a lot more going on with tuples...

    If You only think of tuples as read-only lists, you are going to miss out on some interesting ideas

    We really need to think of tuples also as data records <--- position of values has meaning

    This is why we are going to start looking at tuples before we even cover sequences types

    we are going to focus here on tuples as a data records of structures

    We will also look at named tuples
