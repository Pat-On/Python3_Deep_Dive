        PEP - Python Enhancement Proposals

            These are a fantastic resource to understand how certain things work in PYthon, and
                why they were implemented in a certain way

            not all peps actually make it into PYthon. Some are rejected, deferred or even withdrawn

            Reading the peps that have not been accepted also provides a lot of insight!
            A lot of though by many people go into these PEPs whether they make it or not

                Some PEPs are for language features
                some are informational only
