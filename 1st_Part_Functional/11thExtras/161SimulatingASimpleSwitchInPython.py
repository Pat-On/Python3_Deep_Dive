# Simulating a simple Switch in Python

# check PEP 3103

"""
This is based on a few questions I've received regarding a `switch`
statement in Python.

Python does not have a switch statement, but it is possible to have 
similar functionality in a variety of ways.

Here I'm going to assume a simple `switch` statement where each `case`
 has a `break` (in other words, no fall through), and is based on a single value.

You can see a PEP that discussed adding a `switch` statement to Python,
 proposed by Guido, but ultimately rejected (by Guido as well):

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/



switch (dow) {
    case 1: dowString = 'Monday';
            break;
    case 2: dowString = 'Tuesday';
            break;
    case 3: dowString = 'Wednesday';
            break;
    case 4: dowString = 'Thursday';
            break;
    case 5: dowString = 'Friday';
            break;
    case 6: dowString = 'Saturday';
            break;
    case 7: dowString = 'Sunday';
            break;
    default: dowString = 'Invalid day of week';
}

"""
The simplest approach here is to simply use an `if...elif...else` structure.

To make it slightly more interesting, I'm not going to set a variable 
for each case statement, I'm going to return a function - to keep it 
simple I'll just call the `print()` function, but it could be anything really.

"""
One advantage of using a dictionary (as an associative array), 
is that you can add and remove elements from the dictionary at run time.
 Of course you cannot do that with the `if...elif...else` - you need to
  know at compile time how many branches your "switch" has (just like a regular 
  `switch` would, that is also fixed once the code has been compiled+
).

But the downside of this approach compared to `if...elif...else` is that
 the dictionary values are relatively simple and cannot contain nested 
 if statements or anything else. In the case of `if...elif...else` 
 your code blocks for each of these statement can contain as many lines 
 of code as you want.

So the choice is yours, and depends on what you are trying to accomplish.

Now, there is also another way to do this, and it is based on the concepts
I discuss in the decorator videos on the single dispatch generic functions.

We cannot use the standard library's `@singledispatch` decorator,
but we can adapt the approach I showed you to create a `switch` 
function where we can register each `case` of the `switch`.

First, let's recall our own implementation of the `@singledispatch` decorator:

"""


def singledispatch(fn):
    registry = dict()
    registry[object] = fn

    def register(type_):
        def inner(fn):
            registry[type_] = fn
            return fn  # we do this so we can stack register decorators!
        return inner

    def decorator(arg):
        fn = registry.get(type(arg), registry[object])
        return fn(arg)

    decorator.register = register
    return decorator


"""
With this decorator, we are dispatching based on the type.
 But if you think of our `switch` statement, we really just want 
 to dispatch based on a value (like the `dow` value).

So let's tweak the decorator to no longer use a type, but an arbitrary value instead:
"""


def switcher(fn):
    registry = dict()
    registry['default'] = fn

    def register(case):
        def inner(fn):
            registry[case] = fn
            return fn  # we do this so we can stack register decorators!
        return inner

    def decorator(case):
        fn = registry.get(case, registry['default'])
        return fn()

    decorator.register = register
    return decorator


@switcher
def dow():
    print('Invalid day of week')


@dow.register(1)
def dow_1():
    print('Monday')


dow.register(2)(lambda: print('Tuesday'))
dow.register(3)(lambda: print('Wednesday'))
dow.register(4)(lambda: print('Thursday'))
